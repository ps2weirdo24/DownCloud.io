DownCloud.io is my latest project that runs on Flask. I wanted to make a simple website that actually did something useful.
This is one of my first "big" projects and I will be using it to learn some of the basics of web development.

TODO:
1. Add a link to the banner directing back to the landing page.
2. Create an "about" page were users can contact me and submit any bugs/problems/suggestions
3. Fix directory structure within the user downloaded zip file.
4. Learn about regex and use it to check urls before calling them.
5. Win the lottery

If you have any suggestions or complaints send me an email at ryangaudy@gmail.com or message me on Reddit /u/seeyasunday.
